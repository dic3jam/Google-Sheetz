# Google Sheetz

I am doing a lot of coding in Google App Scripts for my internship at SuperThinSaws, and thought to collect my efforts into a repository.

## Entangle

A short google sheets script that "entangles" two cells such that if you update one, it will update the other and vice versa.

Add a trigger in Google Sheets to update on changes and this will keep the cells up to date.

I made this for my internship at SuperThinSaws.

## Macros

This is not my work and came from a consultant that the owner had previosuly hired

## sideNav

Adds the options for a side navigation bar used on the ordering form sheet (it is rather lengthy and this was an effort to make it easier for the salesman to use)

## triggers

If you have multiple triggers spread across multiple files, it is easier to consolidate the functions to trigger as such. When GS renders your apps scripts code, it smushes everything into one file, so if you have multiple "onOpen" calls it is going to get confused.
