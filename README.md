# Google Sheetz

I am doing a lot of coding in Google App Scripts for my internship at SuperThinSaws, and thought to collect my efforts into a repository.

## Entangle

A short google sheets script that "entangles" two cells such that if you update one, it will update the other and vice versa.

Add a trigger in Google Sheets to update on changes and this will keep the cells up to date.

I made this for my internship at SuperThinSaws.
